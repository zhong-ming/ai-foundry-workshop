        "We'll optionally remove the vector store, the uploaded files, and the agent. In a production environment, you might keep them around longer. Meanwhile, here are some tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Resource Management**\n",
        "   - Keep files grouped by category, regularly prune old or irrelevant files.\n",
        "   - Clear out test agents or vector stores once you're done.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Search Queries**\n",
        "   - Provide precise or multi-part queries.\n",
        "   - Consider synonyms or alternative keywords (\"gluten-free\" vs \"celiac\").\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Health Information**\n",
        "   - Always disclaim that you are not a medical professional.\n",
        "   - Encourage users to see doctors for specific diagnoses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Performance**\n",
        "   - Keep an eye on vector store size.\n",
        "   - Evaluate search accuracy with `azure-ai-evaluation`!\n"
