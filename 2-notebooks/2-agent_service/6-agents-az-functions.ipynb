        "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use **Azure Functions** with the **Azure AI Foundry** SDKs (`azure-ai-projects`, `azure-ai-inference`, `azure-ai-evaluation`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, and `azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry`). We'll demonstrate how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Set up** an Azure Function that listens on a storage queue.\n",
        "2. **Create** an AI Agent that can invoke this function.\n",

        "4. **Retrieve** the processed result from the output queue.\n",

        "All with a fun, health-and-fitness-themed example! We'll keep it whimsical, but remember:\n",

        "> **This example is for demonstration purposes only and does not provide genuine medical or health advice.** Always consult a professional for real medical or fitness advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "1. Azure Subscription.\n",
        "2. **Azure AI Foundry** project. (You'll need your `PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING` and `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.)\n",
        "3. **Azure Functions** environment or local emulator (Azurite), plus storage queue knowledge.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Azure Function** is set up to read messages from an **input queue** and write responses to an **output queue**.\n",
        "2. **AI Agent** is created with an `AzureFunctionTool` that references these queues.\n",
        "3. **User** provides a question or command; the agent decides whether or not to call the function.\n",
        "4. The agent sends a message to the **input queue**, which triggers the function.\n",
        "5. **Azure Function** processes the message, sends back a response to the **output queue**.\n",
        "6. The agent picks up the response from the output queue.\n",
        "7. The **User** sees the final answer from the agent.\n",
